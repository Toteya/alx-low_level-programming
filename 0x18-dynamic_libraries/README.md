# 0x18. C - Dynamic libraries 

## Tasks:
* -0. Create the dynamic library libdynamic.so containing all the functions listed below:

* -1. Create a script that creates a dynamic library called liball.so from all the .c files that are in the current directory.

* -2. Create a dynamic library that contains C functions that can be called from Python. 

* -3. I bought a ticket for the Giga Millions and chose these numbers: 9, 8, 10, 24, 75 + 9. If you could run two commands on the same server where the Giga Millions program runs, could you make me win the Jackpot?
